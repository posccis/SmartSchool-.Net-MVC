## :dart: Goals

- The API
  
  <p> The first goal is to develop the REST API to manage the school's data. It include develop the Models, Controllers with all the HTTP requests.</p>

- The data base
  
  <p> After the API we'll got to make the migration to the MySQL(It's a code first project). To do the migration we have to make all the connection with the DB.</p>

- The view
  
  <p> Till this point we'll only use C#, but to do the front end we'll use AngularJS that use JavaScript. The front-ent is the graphic interface to the common user consume the API and acess the data in a mmore nice way. </p>

## :point_right: Repository pattern

<p>Just learned the Repository pattern. Used this to make generic commands to the controllers and create one more layer in my project.</p>

## :point_right: DTO or Data Tranfer Object

<p>In this momenet of the course i learned the use of Dto's. They're useful to define how and wich data will be delivered to user. And is also one more layer.</p>
